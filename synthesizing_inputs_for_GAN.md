## [Synthesizing the preferred inputs for neurons in neural networks via deep generator networks](https://www.google.com.tw/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwj_jOqc6dvQAhWKfbwKHaG3B8YQFggaMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fabs%2F1605.09304&usg=AFQjCNFSkaNfiK04_LFwaUwo5l4yD4sfcw&sig2=52CYBnpnwFlgjs5s3ov-bw)

This paper performs activation maximization (AM) using GAN, which uses GAN to synthesize a realistic input that highly activates a neuron in the DNN that we want to understand.
We can then visualize synthesized images to interpret what each of the neurons in the DNN learned to detect.
