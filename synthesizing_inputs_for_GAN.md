## [Synthesizing the preferred inputs for neurons in neural networks via deep generator networks](https://www.google.com.tw/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwj_jOqc6dvQAhWKfbwKHaG3B8YQFggaMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fabs%2F1605.09304&usg=AFQjCNFSkaNfiK04_LFwaUwo5l4yD4sfcw&sig2=52CYBnpnwFlgjs5s3ov-bw)

This paper performs activation maximization (AM) using GAN to synthesize realistic images as inputs and feed it into the DNN we want to understand.
By visualizing synthesized images that highly activate particular neurons in the DNN, we can interpret what each of neurons in the DNN learned to detect.
