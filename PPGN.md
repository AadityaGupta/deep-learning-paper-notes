## [Plug & Play Generative Networks: Conditional Iterative Generation of Images in Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00005)

This paper introduced a framework bases on activation maximization and composed of 

1. A generator network G that is capable of drawing a wide range of image types
2. A **replacable** condition network C that tells the gnerator what to draw

The proposed model is able to generate images for all 1000 ImageNet classes or become a text-to-image model conditioning on caption **without** retraining G.
